# Screen-Extractor
<h2>Extracts text from a region of the screen, saves it to a text file and much more!</h2>

<h3>About</h3>

Using hotkeys, this program can:
* Extract text from a user-defined area on the screen and save it to an accessable <i>.txt</i> file called <i>extractedText.txt</i>
* Send keystrokes to the active window using the <i>extractedText.txt</i> file. It can either send the raw text (all spaces and indents included) or it can send an edited version (without the extra white-space)
* Recursively extracts text from the screen and sends keystrokes for a user-defined number of times at a user-defined speed.

All data is saved as <i>.txt</i> files and is stored in the <i>data</i> folder to allow the user ease of access as to enable easy modification and integration into other programs.
